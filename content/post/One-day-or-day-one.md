The reason people die with ideas is that they wait for tomorrow. They wait for perfect conditions. They wait to know every detail.<!--more--> They won't settle on a task, or a commitment because one day they are going to do it. 

It is what they say, "One day I will do it." Life happens and they die. Whether you know what your dreams are or not, today might be your lucky day to get started.

You can instead say:<br>

Today is day one of dating...<br>
Today is day one of starting a business...<br>
Today is day one of quitting a bad habit...<br>
Today is day one of (Fill in with what you want to achieve)<br>

You can start now. Take that first step now.
