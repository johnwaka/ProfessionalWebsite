You will meet all sorts of people in this world. Some will tell you that transcription or writing is not your thing. Others will give you a blueprint to success -- a sure or the only way of doing things. And some of these <!--more--> things will be true, but it doesn’t mean there is no other way around them. What works for me may not work for you. 

So, do not let anyone’s thoughts and opinions deter you from trying that which matters to you. If you have to dance, please dance. Jump high and be happy as you come down. Laugh it off as you engage your mental muscles. You will love yourself more and you will appreciate what you do better. No matter what your field is, never doubt yourself. Doubts end when you put an end to them. 

Do not conform to mainstream standards. Happiness is self-service.
