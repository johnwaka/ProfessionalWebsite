The need for perfection. Let us deal with it. We will never be perfect. Let us stop waiting for the right time. 

The right time to write.<br> 
The right time to read.<br>
The right time to start a business.<br> 
The right time to exercise.<br>
The right time to... <br>

Well, you know what you have been waiting for. 

It is never about perfection. It is about consistency. Or better said persistency.  Practice does not make perfect. Practice makes progress.

Today you have all you need. Do not blame it on lack of time or funds. Just start. Start with what you have. Keep moving. Keep rising. 

And remember; we all start from somewhere. Even the big giants started somewhere.
