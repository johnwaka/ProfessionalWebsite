Great ideas will remain great ideas unless they are acted upon. If you do not start, you won't know what you are capable of. Acting on your ideas gives you a chance to know what is best for you.<!--more--> 

If you start, at least you will fail. 

Which is a good thing.

**Good thing!!😏😏 

Yes it is good thing to fail as it shows what does not work and hence what to do so that it can work. Then you will focus your energy in the right areas.

Here is the process: 
<br>
✔Have great ideas.<br>
✔Act on ideas. <br>
✔Make mistakes/fail.<br>
✔Learn from mistakes.<br> 
✔Rise again. 

So what ideas are you working on today?
