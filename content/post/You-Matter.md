Life is the job description that each one of us was given. We all have a purpose. We all matter. God created us so that<!--More-->we can matter. 

That we can do something and not just anything. Whatever you choose to do, do it diligently. Take all the energy in. Do it all. And then you will make an impact. 

Maybe you will be the only person to be impacted but at least you would have helped that one person -- yourself. 

Keep showing up. Keep learning. Keep growing. Soon you will see the fruits of your garden -- your work. 

And remember; You matter. Let no one stop you.
